Hi Sir,

In This Project you can get all bank and branch details easily i made this project using the REST API.
In This Project, I Created a model for a bank or branch where the bank is added to the branch as a foreign key and added an is_active statement to give me details on whether it is active or not.
I also created a serializer for converting the model data or query set data into the JSON and you can get the branch details using the ifsc _code as a dynamic URL.

I know I took lots of time to complete this assignment because of personal reasons but I gave my best I hope you like this assignment.

Thank you
